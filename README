Search code for construction arms in Conway's Game of Life

elbow.py searches for atomic elbow operations in Golly. There are 
parameters to alter at the top of the code, including the output file.

gp-compile.py is a standalone python program to compile atomic 
operations into a more useful recipe. The location of the recipe file is 
specified at the top of the file. The input is taken from STDIN e.g.:

python gp-compile < recipe.txt
